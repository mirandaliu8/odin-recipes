        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This dish is common Cantonese-style dish that is normally cooked with a whole chicken and served cold. While using a whole chicken is not only more delicious and healthier, the idea of this version came from the fact that as a university student at the time, I did not have the luxury of time to poach a whole chicken every time I craved this dish. I instead decided to substitute it with either chicken breast or chicken wings, depending on what I had on hand or on my preference that day. The recipe I am sharing today involves chicken wings and is much quicker and simpler than dealing with a whole chicken. (However, I do highly recommend cooking with a whole chicken if possible!)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lbs chicken wings</li>
                <li>2 tbsp rice cooking wine</li>
                <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1.5 oz ginger</li>
                <li>2 oz green onion (scallion)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt (for boiling water)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt (for ginger scallion sauce--optional)</li>
                <li>pepper</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the chicken wings into flats, drums, and tips.</li>
                <li>Add the 1 tsp of salt to a pot of water and set to boil.</li>
                <li>Boil the chicken wings until thoroughly cooked, about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the size of the chicken wings.</li>
                <li>Drain chicken wings and set aside. As there are two options for serving, you may plate the cooked and drained chicken wings to be ready to serve or simply set aside for the quick stir-frying later. If you prefer the cold version of the dish, let the wings cool to room temperature before placing it in the fridge.</li>
                <li>To prepare the sauce, mince the green onions and ginger.</li>
                <li>Heat up oil on medium heat in a sauce pan or larger, depending on the serving preference chosen.</li>
                <li>Add the minced ginger and green onions and stir-fry for about 2 minutes to bring out the flavor.</li>
                <li>Mix in the cooking wine, oyster sauce, pepper, and water and let it simmer until the consistency thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>If serving as a drizzle or sauce on the side, take the pan off the heat and either drizzle over the plated chicken wings or into a sauce dish as desired.</li>
                <li>If serving it as a marinade for the chicken wings, toss the chicken wing with the sauce in the pan for a couple minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately!</li>
            </ol>
