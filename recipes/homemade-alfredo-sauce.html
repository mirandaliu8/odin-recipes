        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When cooking food, sauces especially, many of us tend to immediately choose the simplest route--using store bought ready-prepared sauces. We go down the aisles of our grocery stores and after finding the sauce we need, then comes the decision of which brand. There is always the person who reads up on the best ones on the Internet prior to leaving the house, but there is also always the person who ends up trying them all, picking one at random and hoping for the best. For pasta sauces, I tended to be the latter.</p>

           <p>My only problem with store-bought alfredo sauces was that they all had this strange aftertaste that I assumed is attributed to the preservatives used to keep it on shelves for longer periods of time. Alfredo sauces have a dairy base and and would not naturally last long out of a fridge. It wasn't until halfway through university that I decided I needed to learn how to make my own alfredo sauce since I loved it so much yet hated store-bought ones.</p>

            <p>As it turns out, it ended up being much easier than I imagined it would be. Thus began my (short) journey in creating an alfredo sauce that suits my tastes, and I have never looked back to store-bought ones since.</p>
