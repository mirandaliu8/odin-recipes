        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken feet (or Fung Zhao in Cantonese) is one of the many classic dim sum dishes in any authentic Chinese Dim Sum Restaurant. As a first generation Chinese American, growing up around American and Asian American peers, I have seen varying opinions on this dish. Chicken feet as a main ingredient may sound strange from the Western perspective but is enjoyed by many cultures in Asia. However, chicken feet dishes tend to draw opinions from the two extremes--people either love it or hate it with very few in-between. </p>
            
            <p>It is a dish that is a personal favorite of mine, and I never go to a dim sum restaraunt without ordering at least two of them. Unfortunately with where I live, dim sum restaurants are hard to come by. We would have to either drive three hours to the nearest big city or wait until we traveled to New York City to visit family. As a result, my family has tried to replicate the dish in our own way. Particularly without any hot chili, since my mother cannot eat spicy foods well.</p> 
            
            <p>Making dim sum styled chicken feet at home is not easy. Especially without a pressure cooker available. While we have tried following others' recipes found online, it always took too much time to cook the chicken feet soft and tender enough to the way we like it. Thus, we began to create our own recipe through trial and error, resulting in what we discovered to be our own version of the classic dim sum chicken feet dish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 package (1.5 lbs) chicken feet (available in most Asian grocery stores)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons corn starch</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fermented black beans</li>
                <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>4 slices of ginger</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder (or 3 tablespoons chicken stock)</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tablespoons honey or sugar (less or more depending on desired sweetness level)</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Salt to taste (if desired)</li>
                <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Preparation</h2>

            <p>Properly and thoroughly clean the chicken feet by running the chicken feet under cold water and trimming of the claws with scissors. Exfoliate the skin if needed with coarse salt to remove any surface impurities, rinse again to remove the excess salt, and drain out the water.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Be careful when deep frying!</strong> Oil will splatter vigorously upon chicken skin contact with the oil. Pat dry chicken feet with paper towels to minimize oil splatter. Deep fry the chicken feet for about 5 minutes and then remove from oil and set out to drain on a wired rack or on paper towels. Rather than for crispiness, the purpose for deep frying is to puff up the skin so that the sauce added later will be able to seep in between it and the bones and to tenderize.</p>

            <p>The fried chicken feet will then need to be soaked in cold water for about 6 to 9 hours</p>
